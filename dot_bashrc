# If running interactively, and the parent process isn't fish, replace the
# current process with a fish shell.
# This changes the default shell, without breaking use-cases such as scripts
# that expect a POSIX-complient login shell. Skipping this when the parent
# process is fish lets us still be able to manually spawn a bash shell.
